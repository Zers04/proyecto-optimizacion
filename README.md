This project addresses a **discrete optimization problem**: determining the fairest location to hold a concert within the department of **Valle del Cauca**, avoiding favoring one city over another.

The problem is modeled on an **N x N**, where each city has integer coordinates, and the solution must ensure an equitable distribution of distances using the **Manhattan distance**.

---

## üìñ Problem Description

- The concert **cannot be held at the same location as any city**.
- The goal is to find a location such that:
  - The difference between the closest and farthest city to the concert is **‚â§ 2 km**.
  - The **maximum (Manhattan) distance** between the concert and any city is **minimized**.

---

## üßÆ Mathematical Model

**Objective Function**  
Objective Function

```
min ( max di ) donde di = |x - xi| + |y - yi|
```

**Main Constraints**
1. The concert cannot be placed at the same coordinates as a city. 
2. The difference between the closest and farthest city must be ‚â§ 2 km. 
3. The limits of the \(N \times N\) plane must be respected..  

---

## üíª Implementation

The project was developed in **Python** with the following components:

- **Tkinter GUI**: interface to input data (N, number of cities, and their coordinates).
- **Procesamiento**: input validation and constraint verification.
- **Generaci√≥n de c√≥digo MiniZinc**: the system does not directly solve the problem, but **generates the MiniZinc model code**, ready to be executed in the corresponding IDE.

Example of expected input in the interface:

```
12
5
Palmira 2 3
Cali 10 2
Buga 11 0
Tulua 0 3
RioFrio 1 2
```
